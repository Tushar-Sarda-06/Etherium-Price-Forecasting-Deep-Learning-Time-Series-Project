Fetched and preprocessed historical crypto data from Binance API, and scaled prices using MinMaxScaler.
Conducted EDA with Matplotlib and Seaborn to uncover market patterns and correlations in crypto assets.
Engineered time-series features like moving averages(MA100, MA200, MA365) to capture trends and reduce noise.
Built and tuned a multi-layer LSTM model using Keras, optimizing architecture to minimize MSE.Visualized predicted vs actual prices.
performed 10-day future forecasting via auto-regression on last 100 points.
